\chapter{Include using pdfpages}
Include the whole pdf with all pages and some scale down to have our own page numbering.
The pdf has been created from a website using the ``print to pdf'' feature of the \textbf{firefox} web browser which by the way has a very nice pdf viewer with annotation features.
\includepdf[scale=0.9,pages=-,pagecommand={\pagestyle{fancy}}]{appendix/sausageisnotsteel.pdf}
